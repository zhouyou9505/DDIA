what happened if multiple machines are involved in storage and retrieval of
data?

Scalability
if data volume,read load,write load grows bigger than single machine can handle,
you can potentially spread the load across multiple machines.

High availability
if your application needs to continue working even if one machine goes down,you
can use multiple machines give you redundancy.when one fails,another one can
take over.

Latency
if users around the world,I want to have servers at various locations,so that
each user can be served from a data-center that is geo-graphically close to them
to avoid network packet to travel halfway around the world.

Replication
improve performance,served from remaining nodes while some nodes goes down

Partitioning
Splitting a big database into smaller subsets.so that different partitions can
be assigned to different nodes.
